## Project Description

This banking system application implements a complete account management solution with three main components:

### Base Account Class
- Manages core banking operations (deposits, withdrawals)
- Tracks balance, transaction counts, and interest rates
- Handles monthly statements and interest calculations 
### Savings Account
- Specialized account with activity status
- Becomes inactive if balance falls below $10,000
- Additional fees for excessive withdrawals
- Tracks total transaction count
### Current Account
- Supports overdraft functionality
- Automatically manages overdraft payments
- Maintains separate overdraft balance
- Handles partial overdraft repayment

The system includes comprehensive unit tests with 80% code coverage and follows object-oriented principles with proper encapsulation and inheritance. All components are thoroughly documented and maintain clear separation of concerns.
